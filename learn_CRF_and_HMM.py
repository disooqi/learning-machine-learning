Not everything belongs or is mature enough for the central scikit-learn project. The following are projects providing interfaces 
similar to scikit-learn for additional learning algorithms, infrastructures and tasks.

Structured learning

    Seqlearn Sequence classification using HMMs or structured perceptron.
    HMMLearn Implementation of hidden markov models that was previously part of scikit-learn.
    PyStruct General conditional random fields and structured prediction.
    pomegranate Probabilistic modelling for Python, with an emphasis on hidden Markov models.
    sklearn-crfsuite Linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFsuite wrapper with sklearn-like API).
